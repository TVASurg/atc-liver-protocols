    Since 1990, over 800 living liver donations have been successfully performed at Toronto General Hospital, with no donor deaths or long-term disabling complications. Becoming a donor requires excellent health, dedication, and a thorough screening process (only about 1 in 3 applicants qualify for surgery).

<p>
    <strong>Living Donor Referral Process</strong>
</p>
<p>
    All potential recipients undergoing evaluation for liver transplantation will receive the Pre-Liver Transplant Manual during their initial transplant clinic visit.
</p>
<ul>
    <li data-list-item-id="e2d570d274c40dbba1035e6bb7fb4998c">
        This manual outlines the transplant process, including the risks and benefits of living donation.
    </li>
    <li data-list-item-id="ee5f22513bafeef25688b0377159f3f4c">
        If the recipient is interested in pursuing living donation, the manual provides guidance on how to proceed.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Recipients who express interest in living donation will also be provided with the form titled “Evaluation of Living Liver Donors: Information for Liver Transplant Candidates and Caregivers” (LDL-001.SD04) which explains how living donors are evaluated. Members of the recipient team will review and discuss the details of the form with the candidate.

    <strong>Living Donor Initial Contact and Information Process</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Living Donor Assessment Team does not initiate contact with potential donors. It is the responsibility of the interested individual to contact the Living Donor Office directly (via phone, email, in person, or through the UHN Transplant website). Once contact is made, the potential donor is provided with an information package, either through the website, email, mail, or in person.
</p>
<p>
    This package includes:

    Donors must consent to the release or receipt of medical records via the appropriate authorization form and sign a separate consent for email communication. Formal consent to be assessed is obtained by the coordinator using standardized forms for residents or non-residents, ensuring the donor understands the risks, alternatives, and right to opt out. Surgical consent is completed by the surgeon during consultation and includes authorization for blood product use. All signed documents are recorded in the donor’s chart or EPR.&nbsp;
